 \begin{itemize}
      \item  the freedom to run it, 
      \item to study and
      \item change it, and
      \item to redistribute copies with or without  changes. 
     \end{itemize}

      \item republish as they wish
      \item  without restrictions from copyright
      \item patents or other mechanisms of control. 
     \end{itemize}
